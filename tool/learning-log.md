* Something I learned from tinkering with Accoutning is that it is the proccess of keeping track of all financial transactions within a buisness such as money coming in and money going out. I got this from (Here)[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/what-is-accounting/#:~:text=Accounting%20is%20the%20process%20of,in%20and%20money%20going%20out] I also learned that It’s not only important for businesses in terms of record keeping and general management, but also for legal reasons and tax purposes. It provides a full picture of the financial health of your organization and its performance. Which means that it shows how your company is doing in the stocks and its money source.

* Some thing else I had learned about Accouting is that The whole point of accouting  is to give you an idea of what’s working and what’s not working so that you can fix it. Accouting also lets you see if your making profit off your buisness or if your losing. This information isnt just private it is availible to external people such as inverstors who want to invest in your company.
