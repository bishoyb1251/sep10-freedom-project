**Software people used to be able to do Accounting** 
After choosing my topic, Accounting for my Freedom project. I began to research Softwares and hardware that people or Accounters used to be able to use in their daily lives for being able to work as accounters and be able to understand the field of Accounting. First I started researching about softwares that people would use to be able to make accounting a thing. I came across [this website](https://technologyadvice.com/accounting-software/) that talked about the software that accounters used to be able to have the ability to be a thing or to be able to blend together. This site is very reliable because well when you start to scroll down it tells you the authors credintals and what they do. They also give some sites that would allow people to be able to manage accoutning. For example they start off with [zoho books](https://www.zoho.com/us/books/). This is a site that is based around the fact of accoutning and software that accounters are using. It also talks about what the field of accounting is actually about it talks about taxes, and end to end accouting.
