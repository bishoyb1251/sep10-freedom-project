#### Takeaways from the expo elevator pitch

Some takeaways I got from the Expo elevator pitch was that I stuttered really bad at some point. I also just made a bunch of mishmash toghter and called it a day. That was the probably big reason why I ended up getting excluded from the expo.



#### Takeaways from  my in class presentation
I was really happy with what I got in my in class presentation consedering the fact that my website might have not been too good. I really love how I had a bunch of confedince in presenting. One takeaway I had from this is that I would be able to not stutter very much as I did. I also want to finish my website because I put a lot of time in my work so I think its suffeicent to be able to do well on it. According to Mr Mueller he saw that Presentation Feedback: Good presentation! You had two hooks; I think one would suffice (I liked the first one). Beware of the walls of text! Very nice rubber band demo of wow.js! You have a very nice presence/confidence when you present.
