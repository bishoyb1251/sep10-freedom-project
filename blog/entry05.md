### Context 
Some context I learned about while using wow.js was that wow.js is used to make the your page seem a lot more animated. For example if you want to add some bounce or make your page have its own features you would use wow.js. What I mean is for example if I want to make a word slide in from the left I would use a code to make it come in from the left. The page that allowed me to find this out was [wow.js](https://wowjs.uk/). This really allowed me to understand what wow.js was. I did not really know where to go because you have to click on Animate css to bring you to [Animate css](https://animate.style/). If I did not understand anything on this site which has happened before I would ask on slack or maybe even search on youtube. I would also "tinker" as Mr. Mueller like to call it. 

### How do you use wow.js code wise??
First you would have to download wow.js as I have learned so far it is a really short process and you would not regret it when you see your page doing all these weird but cool animations. First you would have to download the program so you would have to use the code `$ npm install animate.css --save` to install it with a npm. From what I learned you can also download it with yarn but that has its limitations to it. Second you would have to import it into your code using `import 'animate.css';`. When you do this your basically done and can use anycode you really want. For example `<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">An animated element</h1>`. This code is an animated element as said in the h1. This code would allow you to be able to make your code bounce. 

### Who would use wow.js?
Well if you are an artist or maybe even a kid it would not matter because EVERYONE can use wow.js to animate their project!!!

### Screenshots?
Well I can't do screenshots with animations but what I can do is say a few codes that you can use to make your page look so much better!!
*<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">An animated element</h1>
*animate__bounce
*animate__rubberBand
*animate__heartBeat
*animate__jello
*animate__wobble
It goes on and on and on but these are the codes that really found me intrigued because of how they could possibly attract someone to your website. 

### Conclusion
To conclude wow.js is mainly used for animation and also used for making your page look so much better then what it would look like without some sort of animation. Also wow.js is amazing.
