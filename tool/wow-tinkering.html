Day 1: Learn how to use
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.css">
<script src="js/wow.min.js"></script>
              <script>
              new WOW().init();
              </script>
    <div class="wow">
    HII
    </div>
This should be able to allow me to make the HII animate. It should be invisible until the user scrolls down on it.
<div class="wow">
    This is not working at all. Let me add more code
    </div>
It did not end up working because I didnt get to activate the code.
It now works because I ended up allowing the code work by adding the start code.

    <section class="wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="5s">
        <div class="wow bounceInUp">
            The code would allow me to make the code bounce in. But I'm not sure why it is not working.
            </div>
    </section>

    <section class="wow slideInRight" data-wow-offset="10"  data-wow-iteration="10">
    </section>
