Tool: **Accounting**

* Something I learned from tinkering with Accoutning is that it is the proccess of keeping track of all financial transactions within a buisness such as money coming in and money going out. I got this from (Here)[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/what-is-accounting/#:~:text=Accounting%20is%20the%20process%20of,in%20and%20money%20going%20out] I also learned that It’s not only important for businesses in terms of record keeping and general management, but also for legal reasons and tax purposes. It provides a full picture of the financial health of your organization and its performance. Which means that it shows how your company is doing in the stocks and its money source.

* Some thing else I had learned about Accouting is that The whole point of accouting  is to give you an idea of what’s working and what’s not working so that you can fix it. Accouting also lets you see if your making profit off your buisness or if your losing. This information isnt just private it is availible to external people such as inverstors who want to invest in your company. In order to do accouting you have to be able to have a bachleors which is 4 years of college. What you would do is provide financial advice and and tax planning. Did you know that you get your checks from your jobs through accounting?? Thats crazy!!

This week I learned how to be able to use my tool which was wow.js to be able to work on my freedom prokect I watched (this)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isr8vaIcKlg&t=113s] To show me how to use it with animate CSS. I used (this page) [https://medium.com/@denishmistry07/on-scroll-text-animation-using-wow-js-394b8a0cbd42]
To allow me to be able to see what kind of code I can use for example one code that I can use to show wow.js is
<section class="wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s" data-wow-delay="5s">
</section>
 <section class="wow slideInRight" data-wow-offset="10"  data-wow-iteration="10">
</section>
data-wow-duration: Change the animation duration
data-wow-delay: Delay before the animation starts
data-wow-offset: Distance to start the animation (related to the browser bottom)
data-wow-iteration: Number of times the animation is repeated


### Learning log #4
This week I learned how to be able to use wow.js and animate css to make a divi (here is the video I used)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YU1_lI0gzY]
I tinkered using (this site)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63286363/how-can-i-use-wow-js-properly]. It showed me a code that I can use to be able to use wow.js correctly. This showed me that Wow.js can be used in Java script. The code that it showed me and that I tinkered with was
``<body>
...
<div class="wow bounce">...</div>
...
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.boomcdn.com/libs/wow-js/1.3.0/wow.js">
</script>
<script>new WOW().init();</script>
</body>``
This showed me that wow.js is used for sometimes Javascript. I also learned that it works with animate css to be able to make the page pop out even more.
