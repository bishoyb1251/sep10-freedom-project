#### Context 
During this project which I made about accoutning I learned alot of things which had included my own webiste about accoutning. I learned that well it was a hard way to be able to learn how code and make my own website because I did not know where to put some things on my website. But we will get to that later. The over all reason why I had decided to make this website about accouting was first I had to for school but also because I saw that Accounting is such a intresting field of work and I thought that it was a good idea to make research on my own about how to use Accouting in my normal life when I grow up or even get a job.

#### How did I make my MVP
I made my MVP by using wow.js, this would allow me to be able to make my page look extremely better then what it actually looks like right now. What wow.js basically does is it just makes your page animated and have affects when you put in a certain code. It also works with animate css to make the page look a little more animated. 

#### Takeaways
Some takeaways that I got from doing this project is before this I did not really know what some of the code needed to make these webistes used. Which is why I had asked questions on slack and I used bootstrap to be able to make my code actually work. I also learned that the carousel is a really important
